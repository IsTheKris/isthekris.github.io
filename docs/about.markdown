Hi, I’m Krishna. I have a Master’s degree in Computer Science and a strong passion for technology, data, and open source tools. I'm currently transitioning into the field of data analytics, building projects, and sharpening my skills in Python, Pandas, and other tools.

I enjoy learning by doing it, whether it's running self hosted services on Raspberry Pi, experimenting with GNU+Linux, or creating useful visualizations from real world data. I'm also interested in web development, automation, and privacy focused tools.

Outside of tech, I love long walks, home cooked food, and reading about science, history, and philosophy. I believe in continuous learning and doing meaningful work that makes life simpler and more open.
