Hi!

The reason I started this blog is to help myself learn better as writing helps understand things more deeply and remember them longer.

This blog will be a place where I collect notes and write about topics that confused me. So that later, I can come back and read these posts for a quick revision when I need to.

I also hope that others who are learning data science may find these posts useful:)
